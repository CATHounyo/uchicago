    "### Why SQLAlchemy?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy and ORM packages are very popular with pythond developers working on non-data science related software/webapps. I think one of the main reasons are \"protection against sql injection attacks\" but it can also be hard to update a project written with [`cx_oracle`](https://cx-oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) when the project owners decide to migrate to a PostGresSQL database for example (migrations happen and not always to the cloud). Imagine how much harder it would be if all the queries were just long multiline strings!\n",

    "        Interfacing with databases is not always straigh forward in python. Although the [DBAPI](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/) specs provides a standard, different developers are free to structure/name their methods as they see fit.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        There are methods and objects that come with SQLAlchemy that allow the user to quickly derive table metadata. This saves time from switching between your python IDE and Oracle SQL Developer for example.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        There is nothing like having great control over the structure of the table you are responsible for. You must make sure that all primary keys are properly identified, that all columns that cannot be null are distinguishable and that database defaults are set.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        If you use an IDE like Pycharm, you probably love how easy it is to refractor objects. Refractoring objects/variables are very easy and the fact that SQLAlchemy provides the object representation of tables and columns; refractoring is often (not always) a piece of cake.\n",
